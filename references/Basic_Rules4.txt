=== 2. RESOLUTION SYSTEM (AUTHORITATIVE) ===
- This section defines the universal dice and success-resolution mechanics used by all systems unless explicitly stated otherwise.

2.1. Core Principle
- This system uses a D10 success-counting mechanic.
- The effective base difficulty threshold is 6.

2.2. Dice Pool Construction
- Let N be the total dice pool size.
- N = relevant stat ranks + relevant skill ranks.

2.3. Die Evaluation
- Each die is evaluated independently.
- Dice pool size (N) and die face value are separate concepts.

2.4. Die results:
- Roll of 1: -1 success
- Roll of 2-5: 0 successes
- Roll of 6-9: +1 success
- Roll of 10:
- +1 success if N < 10
- +2 successes if N >= 10

2.5. Result Calculation
- Sum all success modifiers to obtain Total Successes.

2.6. Botch Condition
- If Total Successes < 0, the result is a Botch.
- A Botch represents complete failure.
- Interpretation and consequences are determined by the DM.
- No other botch conditions exist.

=== 3. ACTION ECONOMY (AUTHORITATIVE) ===
- This section defines the action types available each turn and the rules governing their use and conversion.

3.1. Turn Resources - Actions
Each character turn provides:
- 1 Standard Action
- 1 Bonus Action
- 1 Move Action
- Reaction

3.1.1. Standard Action
- Used to perform a major action (attack, spell, complex interaction).
- May be spent in place of one of the following:
  - a Bonus Action, or
  - a Move Action allowing up to 20 meters of movement, or
  - Preparation of a Reaction (trigger defined at preparation time).

3.1.2. Bonus Action
- Represents minor actions (e.g., drawing or dropping a weapon, specific supernatural powers).
- Cannot be converted into a Standard or Move Action.
- A Standard Action may be spent in place of a Bonus Action to gain an additional Bonus Action.

3.1.3. Move Action
- Allows movement up to 5 meters, unless modified by another rule.
- If a Standard Action is spent in place of a Move Action, the character may move up to 25 meters instead.

3.1.4. Reaction
- A Reaction is a contingent action that triggers automatically when a predefined condition occurs.
- Reactions may be granted by rules, powers, or effects, or may be prepared in advance using a Standard Action.
- Only the specified trigger and response occur; no additional actions may be taken at that time.
- Unless explicitly stated otherwise, a Reaction may occur at most once per round.

3.1.5. Restrictions
- No other action conversions are allowed.

=== 4. COMBAT RESOLUTION (AUTHORITATIVE) ===
- This section defines how physical and magical attacks are resolved, including precedence rules, defensive resolution, and damage calculation.

4.1. Damage Type Precedence
- Every attack is either Physical or Magical.
- Physical attacks use Physical Attack Resolution below.
- Magical attacks use Magical Attack Resolution below.
- DR applies only to Physical damage.
- Soak applies only to Magical damage.
- If any rule conflicts, this section overrides all others

4.2. Magical Attack Resolution
- Magical attacks bypass Attack Roll and Dodge entirely.
- Magical attacks deal a fixed damage value as defined by the effect.
- Final Magical Damage Taken = max(0, Magical Damage - Soak).
- No dice are rolled during magical damage resolution unless explicitly stated by the effect.

4.3. Physical Attack Resolution
- This section defines the step-by-step resolution of physical attacks, including attack rolls, defensive resolution, hit comparison, and damage calculation.

4.3.1. Attack Roll
- Determine attack dice pool:
- Melee: Dexterity + Melee + miscellaneous attack bonuses
- Ranged: Dexterity + Ranged + miscellaneous attack bonuses
- Roll using the D10 Success System.
- Let A be the total number of attack successes.

4.3.2. Automatic Dodge (Passive Defense)
- Dodge is the defensive mechanism; Armor Class (AC) is its numeric value.
- Dodge is a passive defense applied during hit resolution and does not consume actions or reactions.
- Dodge is ignored only if explicitly disabled by a rule (e.g., paralysis).
- All bonuses that modify Dodge contribute to Armor Class (AC).
- Defender Dodge value (Armor Class, AC): AC = Dexterity + miscellaneous dodge bonuses

4.3.3. Hit Resolution
- Compare A and AC:
- If AC > A, the attack misses.
- If A > AC, the attack hits and M = A - AC.
- If A = AC:
- If a player character is involved, the player wins the tie.
- Otherwise, the defender wins.

4.3.4. Damage Resolution (Hit Only)
- Determine attacker Damage Pool (DP):
- DP = weapon damage + all damage bonuses
- Total Damage Pool:
- DP + M
- Roll the Total Damage Pool using the D10 Success System.
- Final Damage Taken:
- max(0, damage successes - defender DR)

=== 5. CHARACTER ATTRIBUTES (AUTHORITATIVE) ===
- This section defines a character's core attributes and how each stat contributes to dice pools, defenses, and derived mechanics.

5.1. STATS
